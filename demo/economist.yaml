text: Apple reported its first drop in quarterly net profit for a decade. It made
    $9.5 billion in the first three months of 2013, which was 17% lower than in the
    same period last year. Profit margins were squeezed by stiffer competition, notably
    from [[Samsung|Samsung|Company]], though sales of iPads and iPhones smashed expectations.
    With a nod to gripes about its falling share price, Apple will now return $100
    billion to investors through share buy-backs and dividends by 2015.

    deciding to keep buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage bonds a month, after

    programme at its September meeting. Delighted that the easy-money tap is not being
    turned off just yet, investors pushed stockmarkets to record highs.

text: BlackBerry reported a $5.9 billion net loss for its financial year ending March
    1st; revenue for its latest quarter came in at under $1 billion for the first
    time since 2007. To boost sales the company is to reintroduce its Bold smartphone
    range, which was launched in 2008 and are especially popular in emerging markets.
    The newer BlackBerry 10 devices, which came to market last year with high hopes
    of turning the company around, have not sold so well.
